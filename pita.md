Pita bread
Ingredients

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp active dry yeast
1/3 cup milk
1/3 cup water
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 cup butter
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped

Instructions

Combine flour, salt, and yeast in a large mixing bowl and whisk together well.
Add warm milk and warm water to bowl with dry ingredients. Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients creating a shaggy-mass.
Add olive oil and knead the dough together using your hands, ensuring all stray bits come together.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, lay a kitchen towel over, and let rest for 1 hour.
Dust a clean work surface with flour and place dough down. Using your hands, work it out into a flat circle.
Cut dough into 6 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, roll each piece into a ball. You should have 6 equal sized dough balls. Cover dough balls with a towel while rolling out each one.
Using a floured rolling pin, roll out one ball into a circle that's about 1/4 inch thick. Repeat with remaining 5 dough balls.
Heat a large pan over medium-high heat and spread a small amount of olive oil. Place pita down and cook until bubbles form, about 30 seconds. Flip over and cook for 1-2 minutes or until bubbles on bottom side are golden-brown. Flip over again and cook 1-2 minutes more until both sides are toasted evenly.
Keep cooked pita bread covered with a kitchen towel. Repeat with remaining pita dough.
Melt butter in microwave safe bowl for 30 seconds. Mince garlic and fresh parsley then add to the melted butter. Spread mixture evenly over each cooked pita to create fragrant garlic pita bread and enjoy!

Notes
Storing – store cooked pita in an airtight bag for up to 3 days. You can warm them up in the toaster, microwave, or over the stove top.
Freezing – let the pita cool completely before storing in an airtight ziplock. Place parchment paper in between each pita and freeze for up to 2 months. Reheat the pita by placing in an oven at 350 F, thawing is not necessary.
Gluten-Free Pita Bread - replace the flour with an all-purpose gluten-free flour.
